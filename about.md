## About Me

Hi! I'm Rob Whitaker. I'm a writer, developer, and functional programming enthusiast, currently employed at IBM as a Software Engineer.

I was born in 1993, started playing with both game design and web development in middle school through high school, and graduated from Marist College in 2015 with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a concentration in Game Design.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading, writing short stories, drinking coffee, playing the piano, longboarding, and gaming.
