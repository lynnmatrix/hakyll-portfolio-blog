Hi! I'm Rob Whitaker, a 21 year old web developer, software engineer, and functional programming enthusiast. I recently graduated from Marist College with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a concentration in Game Design and am currently employed as a Software Engineer (contract) at Unlockable Inc.

Some technologies I enjoy include Elm (functional reactive web programming), JavaScript, Haskell, and Unity, and I am always open to learning new programming languages and development tools. I am passionate about writing code that is clean, efficient, reusable, and easy to debug and maintain.

During my spare time, I always have a personal development project on hand, whether it be a web application, a game of some kind, or even a command line tool. When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading, writing short stories and novellas, playing the piano, and gaming.

With my varied experience and enthusiasm for learning, I believe I would be a strong asset to any development team. If you are interested in contacting me, feel free to shoot me an email. I'd love to hear from you!
